## BB-Bots: A Big Brother (US) Simulator ## 

--> https://spaulmark.github.io/bb-bots/ <--

BB-bots simulates a game of Big Brother, using the US format. You can watch as a cast of your favourite characters win head of household, power of veto, form alliances, and vote to evict each other until only one winner remains. 

Use your own custom cast of images by dragging and dropping them, selecting them from your filesystem, or submitting a list of links to images online. You can also use one of many pre-set casts. It's lots of fun, why not try it out?
