## Understanding Relationships ##

![legend](https://cmsweb.utsc.utoronto.ca/c46blog-f20/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/legend-768x458.png)

Popularity is the average of a playerâ€™s relationships, and dictates the background colour of the card. # of people targeting me indicates the number of players that would nominate this player as an initial nomination if they won HoH.

Pawn/Queen relationships occur when one player (the pawn) likes another player (the queen), but the queen does not care about the pawn. This is a one-sided relationship.

## Understanding Alliances: or "What do the arrows mean?" ##

The arrows show you the overlap between alliances, like a venn diagram. Nemuno is friends with Cirno, and Merlin is friends with Cirno, but Merlin is not nessecarily friends with Nemuno. You can also think of this like the core of an alliance, and its affiliates.

## Understanding Endgame Winrate ##

Jurors typically prefer to vote for their friends, so people with a lot of friends on jury will have an advantage if they make it to the final 2. You can click on players to see what their chances are against each opponent in an F2. If you haven't clicked on anyone, it displays the average chance they have of winning if they made it to the end.
