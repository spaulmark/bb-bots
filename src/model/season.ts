    // wait
    // maybe as i generate them
    /// obviously i generate episode 1 first
    // then i have a hanging async function that is like "get episode 2"
    // and it literally just is an awaiting or something? idk

    // like if its array of async () => episode
    // then if there is NO episode
    // and the generator is still generating episode 2, then

    //maybe it uses subjects or something
